        content: "Grilling the entire bird is the ultimate flavor bomb -- cooking meat on the bone keeps things juicy while the skin crisps up, and turns out an outer layer brimming with flavor. Plus, a whole grilled chicken makes for a stunning presentation. Butterfly it so that it lies flat and grills evenly over direct heat. Bonus: This cuts down the cooking time by half. And small, hibachi-size grills need not apply, as youll need extra grate space to move the chicken around when inevitable flare-ups occur."

        content: "There are two basic cuts of ribs from different parts of the pig Baby Back aka Loin Back ribs and Spare ribs.  Small under 1.3 lbs Loin Back ribs are baby Back ribs.  Back backs are are leaner, tender and have a milder flavor comparable to Beef Filet Mignon.  Spare Ribs have a more robust flavor comparable to a Beef Ribeye.  Its easy to buy whole spareribs and trim them St. Louis style yourself.  All you need is a sharp knife to trim spare ribs into St. Louis ribs.  Spare ribs can be just as lean and tender as Baby Backs when cooked right.  The vast majority of our cooking school students prefer Spare ribs in side by side taste offs.  The Back ribs are more curved and are cut from the area closer to the spine.  The Spare ribs are flatter and come from the stomach area. The only thing that separates back ribs from spare ribs is a cut made by a band saw.  Butchers will run a pork shoulder also known as a Boston Butt through a band saw and call them country style ribs.  Some competition cooks have great success with Baby Back Ribs which cook faster than Spare Ribs.  Both styles of pork ribs win competitions.  All our awards have been won with BBQ Spare ribs."
