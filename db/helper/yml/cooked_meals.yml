        directions: "Thaw meatballs overnight in the refrigerator. Pre-heat oven to 375 degrees. Pour meatballs into aluminum tray and cover with orange glaze. Bake for one hour and stir meatballs after 30 minutes. Wash and cook rice. Wash vegetables, chop the cucumbers into half-circles and tomatoes into wedges and mix with salad mix. Make sure meatballs are cooked by seeing if the middle of the meatball is hot."
